Hey, I‚Äôm Sam. 
<!-- üëã -->

I‚Äôm a synthesist, audio/electronics engineer and programmer with a passion for instrument design. I‚Äôm currently based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington), Aotearoa (New Zealand).

I started my journey at jazz school, but my interest in electronic music and audio engineering led me into the world of sonic art. I graduated with a Bachelor of Music (First Class Honours) in Composition (specializing in Sonic Art) at Te K≈çkƒ´ New Zealand School of Music. 

During my sonic arts studies, my love for building left-field instruments and interfaces pulled me further into engineering and down the DSP/embedded systems rabbit hole. I recently completed a Master of Engineering (Electronics and Computer Systems) at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington, where my thesis focused on designing wave terrain synthesis hardware for Eurorack modular systems. 
 
Over the years, I‚Äôve also released [acousmatic music](https://musicalelectronicslibrary.bandcamp.com/track/pheromone-party), tutored audio production and programming courses, [profiled](https://natlib.govt.nz/items?i%5Bprimary_collection%5D=findNZarticles&text=sam+carswell&direction=desc&sort=sort_date) numerous New Zealand artists, started an open-access modular synth system at my local library, and hosted a bleary-eyed after-hours radio show.

Let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôm always up for a chat ‚Äî especially about instrument design, synthesis, and (my current obsession) bells.
